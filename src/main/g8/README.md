# Introduction

A [Giter8](http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/) template for generating a document based on [Tufte-LaTeX](https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/), a Tufte-inspired LaTeX class for producing books.

Projects generated from _tufte-latex-book.g8_ come with starter text from the original Tufte-LaTeX distribution that demonstrates the document style, including graphics, table of contents, bibliography and index generation, etc. The default document serves as a reference to the format. To get started, generate your own project and start working in the generated '.tex' and '.bib' file, disposing of starter content as needed.

# Prerequisites

To use the _tufte-latex-book.g8_ template to generate project husks and successfully compile them, you'll need:

 * [Giter8](http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/)
 * [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (or reasonably compatible version of make; exotic features aren't used)
 * [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)
 * The PDF viewer of your choice (the generated Makefile assumes Mac OS X Preview.app)

# Creating a Project

To create a new working project invoke giter8 using the giter8 template:
```console
foo@bar:~$ g8 jerrykuch/tufte-latex-book.g8
```
Enter a name for the project when prompted. A canonicalized version of the name you enter, with all letters lower-cased and spaces replaced by hyphens, will be used for the name of the directory created and as the base name of the '.tex' and '.bib' files created therein.

# Project Structure

If you entered "My First Project" when instantiating the Giter8 template, you'll end up with a directory of the following structure:
```
my-first-project/
├── History.txt
├── Makefile
├── Manifest.txt
├── README.txt
├── graphics
│   ├── . . . various image files in various formats . ..
├── my-first-project.bib
├── my-first-project.tex
├── tufte-book.cls
├── tufte-common.def
└── tufte-handout.cls
```
Manifest.txt identifies all of the files that came from the original Tufte-LaTeX distribution. The 'graphics' directory contains the sample images from the Tufte-LaTeX sample document. Once you're no longer referring to any of the provided images, delete them.

You'll do your editing in 'my-first-project.tex' and 'my-first-project.bib' for main document and bibliography respectively. The actual names you see depend on what you gave to Giter8 during generation.

# Usage

The main targets of interest in the Makefile are 'pdf' and 'preview'. To generate a finished PDF of your document, run:
```console
foo@bar:~$ make pdf
```
To preview the PDF, run:
```console
foo@bar:~$ make preview
```
The Makefile is currently set up for Mac OS X and will open the PDF using whatever PDF viewer is configured (Preview.app by default). Edit the appropriate line in the Makefile to invoke your preferred PDF viewer.

To clean up the various chaff files generated by a build of the document use the 'clean' target:
```console
foo@bar:~$ make clean
```

A gitignore file is provided that should keep you from accidentally checking in most of the ephemeral detritus that LaTeX generates during a compilation.

SyncTeX files are generated to ease navigation between LaTeX source code and the PDF output. Things should work out of the box if you're using TeXShop or similar.
